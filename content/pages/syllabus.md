Description
-----------

"Until women are as ambitious as men, they're not going to achieve as much as men."  
Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook Executive and author of _Lean In._

"Young men keep telling me they don't 'have it all' either. And they may have a point. But if you define 'having it all' as the opportunity to have a successful career and a family, I'd say this. When a man tells his coworkers he's going to have a child, no one asks him how he'll manage or if he'll be coming back to work."  
Anne-Marie Slaughter, President and CEO of the New America Foundation and author of _Why Women Can't Have it All_.

"Seek out and learn from people with a different perspective on history. To create our multicultural future, all people's voices and perspectives must be welcome."  
Juana Bordas, author of _Salsa, Soul, and Spirit: Leadership for a Multicultural Age._
